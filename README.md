# myDiscord
Hey!
Here you can find my project on making a discord-like app  
you can log-in, chat with other people, interact with them etc etc  
It's not finished yet, but feel free to check and report me any bugs!  
i've started working on this very early, but i'm proud of what i made in a short amount of time  



patch note 0.1: 4/18/23 5:50 AM
* App still under development  
* you can register and login  
* the VC is ready but not implemented  
* you can't log out without closing the window  
* you can only create one account by email  
* your password need a minimum of 6 characters  
* nothing is hosted, so actually it's only local  
  
patch note 0.2: 4/18/23 11:03 AM
* You can now log-out from your account
* Your ID is now shown on the left corner
* The "Friend" button can only be triggered, nothing will really happen
* each account will have his own SQL table for each messages he receives
* added the slot for the vocal button, but still in development
